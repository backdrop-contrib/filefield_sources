# FileField Sources

This module enhances the generic and image upload fields so that you can populate
any file field from a variety of sources, such as entering remote URLs directly,
re-use existing uploaded files, pull from a server directory, or a variety of other
possibilities.

## Installation

1. Install and enable this module using the official Backdrop CMS instructions
   at https://backdropcms.org/guide/modules
2. Add or configure an existing file or image field.
   * To configure a typical node field, visit Admin -> Structure -> Content types
     and click "Manage fields" on a type you'd like to modify. Add a new file or
     image field or edit an existing one.
   * While editing the file or image field, you'll have new options available
     under a "File sources" fieldset. You can enable the desired sources for that
     particular field.
3. Create a piece of content that uses your file and try it out.
